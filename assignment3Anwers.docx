1. What are the assumptions of linear regression? 
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input and 
output variables. It also assumes that the residuals (errors) are normally 
distributed, have constant variance , the data points are independent, and 
that the input features are not highly correlated.
 
2. When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression? 
Logistic regression should be used when the target variable is categorical, 
especially for binary classification (like 0 or 1, yes or no). Linear regression 
is not suitable for classification because it predicts continuous values, not 
probabilities. 
3. What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression? 
Each coefficient in logistic regression shows how a one-unit change in a 
feature affects the log-odds of the positive outcome. A positive coefficient 
increases the probability of the positive class, while a negative one 
decreases it. 
4. What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions? 
The sigmoid function is used in binary classification and gives a probability 
between 0 and 1. The softmax function is used for multiclass classification 
and gives a probability distribution across all possible classes. 
5. Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression 
models? 
R-squared measures how well a model explains variance in a continuous 
outcome, which works for linear regression. Logistic regression predicts 
categories, so evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC
AUC are more appropriate.
